1.    Differentiate between list, tuples and dictionary.  
Ans:     
           List                                Tuple                              Dictionary
 *List is an ordered collection     *Tuple is an ordered collection   *Dictionary is unordered collection.
  of items.                          of items.

 *List are mutable object           * Tuple is an immutable object.   *Dictionary are mutable object  
  i.e. it is possible to add new                                       i.e. it is possible to add new
  item or delete and item from it.                                     item or delete and item from it.                                  

 *A list, in Python, stores a       *A tuple is though similar to a   *A dictionary is an associative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  sequence of objects in a defined   list, but it’s immutable.         array of key-value pairs. It’s                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  order. They allow indexing or      Another semantic difference       unordered and requires the keys                                                                                                                              
  iterating through the list. Next,  between a list and a tuple is     to be hashable.Search operations                                                                                                                                  
  lists are mutable which you can    “Tuples are heterogeneous data    happen to be faster in a dictionary                                                  
  modify after creation.             structures whereas the list is    as they use keys for lookups.                                                                                      
                                     a homogeneous sequence.                                                      
                                                                                                                                         


2.    Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.
Ans:  d = {'Red': 1, 'Green': 2, 'Blue': 3} 
      for color_key, value in d.items():
      print(color_key, 'corresponds to ', d[color_key]) 


3.    Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.
Ans:  def returnSum(myDict): 
      sum = 0
      for i in myDict: 
      sum = sum + myDict[i] 
      return sum
      dict = {'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300} 
      print("Sum :", returnSum(dict))

4.    Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one. Sample Dictionary: 
               a. dic1= {1:10, 2:20} 
               b. dic2= {3:30, 4:40} 
               c. dic3= {5:50, 6:60}
Ans:  dic1={1:10, 2:20}
      dic2={3:30, 4:40}
      dic3={5:50,6:60}
      dic4 = {}
      for d in (dic1, dic2, dic3): dic4.update(d)
      print(dic4)  
               

5.    Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary. 
Ans:  d = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
      def is_key_present(x):
      if x in d:
      print('Key is present in the dictionary')
      else:
      print('Key is not present in the dictionary')
      is_key_present(5)
      is_key_present(9)
